            <p><strong>Effective Date: October 22, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to NAUDO COMPANY LIMITED. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the services,
                software, and products provided by NAUDO COMPANY LIMITED ("NAUDO," "we," "us," or "our"), an IT software
                development firm based in Kenya.</p>

            <h3>1. Scope of Services</h3>
            <p>NAUDO provides custom software development, mobile application development, web application services, and
                IT consultancy. Specific project details, deliverables, timelines, and fees will be outlined in a
                separate Statement of Work (SOW) or a Service Agreement, which shall supersede these Terms in case of
                conflict.</p>

            <h3>2. Intellectual Property & Ownership</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom Software:</strong> Unless otherwise specified in the SOW, upon full and final
                    payment, the client shall own the intellectual property rights to the final code, design, and
                    deliverables specifically created for them.</li>
                <li><strong>NAUDO Products:</strong> Digital products like SmartBiz ERP Suite and Naudo HR Cloud are
                    licensed, not sold. NAUDO retains all intellectual property rights to its proprietary products,
                    components, libraries, and base code. Your right to use such products is governed by the specific
                    end-user license agreement (EULA) provided with the product.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Payment and Fees</h3>
            <p>All project fees are quoted and payable in Kenyan Shillings (KES), unless otherwise agreed in the SOW.
                Payments are subject to the schedule defined in the SOW. Late payments may result in the suspension of
                service or software access.</p>

            <h3>4. Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>NAUDO warrants that all services will be performed in a professional manner. However, we do not warrant
                that the operation of the software will be uninterrupted or error-free. NAUDO shall not be liable for
                any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
                services or products, up to the maximum extent permitted by Kenyan law.</p>

            <h3>5. Termination</h3>
            <p>Either party may terminate a project or service agreement with written notice if the other party breaches
                a material term of the agreement. Specific termination clauses and fees will be outlined in the SOW.</p>

            <h3>6. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them shall be governed by and
                construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Kenya.</p>
