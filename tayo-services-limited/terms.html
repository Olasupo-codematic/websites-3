                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By engaging TAYO Services Limited ("TAYO," "we," "us," or "our") for content writing and copywriting
                    services or by downloading any digital product, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service
                    ("Terms").</p>

                <h2>2. Services and Deliverables</h2>
                <p>TAYO agrees to provide professional content writing and copywriting services as outlined in a
                    specific, mutually agreed-upon Service Agreement or Statement of Work (SOW). Deadlines, scope of
                    work, and revision rounds will be strictly defined in the SOW.</p>

                <h2>3. Payment and Currency</h2>
                <p>All prices for services are quoted in **Kenyan Shillings (KES)** unless otherwise specified in the
                    SOW. Payment terms (e.g., upfront deposit, milestones) will be detailed in the SOW. Failure to
                    adhere to payment schedules may result in a pause of service delivery.</p>

                <h2>4. Intellectual Property & Copyright</h2>
                <p>Upon full and final payment, the client is granted exclusive, perpetual, worldwide rights to the
                    final written content provided by TAYO. TAYO retains the right to use samples of the work for
                    portfolio and promotional purposes, unless a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is in place.</p>

                <h2>5. Digital Products</h2>
                <p>Digital products (e.g., The Brand Voice Playbook) are licensed to the purchaser for personal or
                    internal business use only. Redistribution, resale, or sharing of these resources is strictly
                    prohibited.</p>

                <h2>6. Termination</h2>
                <p>Either party may terminate a Service Agreement with written notice. In the event of client
                    termination, the client is responsible for paying for all work completed up to the date of
                    termination, based on the agreed-upon milestones or an assessment of time spent.</p>

                <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
