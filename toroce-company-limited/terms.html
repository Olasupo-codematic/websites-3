            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>By engaging TOROCE COMPANY LIMITED for digital consultancy and social media marketing services, you agree
                to be bound by these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). These Terms govern all services provided, including
                strategy, campaign execution, and content deliverables.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2. Scope of Marketing Deliverables</h3>
            <p>TOROCE provides services on a project-by-project or retainer basis, as outlined in a specific Service
                Agreement (SOW). Deliverables, including strategy documents, content calendars, and campaign reports,
                will be detailed in the SOW. TOROCE commits to delivering professional, high-quality digital marketing
                services in good faith.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">3. Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>The client must provide all necessary access (e.g., social media platform logins, ad account access) and
                timely feedback required for TOROCE to perform its services. Delays caused by lack of access or feedback
                may impact project timelines.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">4. Usage Rights and Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>Upon final payment for services rendered, the client shall own the intellectual property rights to all
                original content and strategies created specifically for them under the SOW. TOROCE retains the right to
                use non-confidential campaign results and aggregated data for case study and promotional purposes.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">5. Fees and Payment (KES)</h3>
            <p>All fees are quoted and payable in **Kenyan Shillings (KES)** unless otherwise agreed upon. Invoices are
                due net thirty (30) days from the invoice date. TOROCE reserves the right to suspend services for
                outstanding payments.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">6. Disclaimer of Guarantee</h3>
            <p>Digital marketing involves inherent risks and market variables. TOROCE COMPANY LIMITED guarantees
                professional effort and strategic execution but does not guarantee specific results (e.g., sales volume,
                follower count) as these outcomes are influenced by factors outside our control (e.g., platform
                algorithms, market competition).</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">7. Contact Information</h3>
