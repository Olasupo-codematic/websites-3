        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 22, 2024</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the KAGIME COMPANY
            LIMITED website and purchasing digital products (the "Service").</p>

        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
            terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h3>2. Digital Delivery Process</h3>
        <p>Upon successful payment confirmation (in a real-world scenario; simulated in this demo), all digital products
            (templates, kits, guides) will be delivered to the email address provided during the purchase process.
            Delivery is typically instantaneous, but may take up to 24 hours. The download link provided via email is
            for the exclusive use of the purchaser.</p>

        <h3>3. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property
            of KAGIME COMPANY LIMITED. The products you purchase are licensed to you for your own use. You may **not**
            resell, redistribute, or use them for commercial resale purposes without explicit written consent.</p>

        <h3>4. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital goods (immediately accessible and non-returnable), all sales are generally
            **final and non-refundable** once the product has been delivered via email. A refund may be considered only
            if the file is proven to be defective or significantly misrepresented.</p>

        <h3>5. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Kenya, without regard to its
            conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h3>6. Contact Information</h3>
