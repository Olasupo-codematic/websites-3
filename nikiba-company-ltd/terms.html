        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By purchasing and downloading any digital ebook package ("Product") from NIKIBA COMPANY LIMITED, you agree to
            be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not
            purchase our Products.</p>

        <h3>2. Digital Download and Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Instant Access:</strong> Upon successful payment, you will receive an email confirmation and/or
                a download link that provides instant access to the digital Product(s).</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> Delivery is defined as the moment the download link is made available to you.
                NIKIBA COMPANY LIMITED is not responsible for any delay or failure in delivery due to circumstances
                outside our reasonable control (e.g., incorrect email address provided by the customer, issues with the
                customer's internet service provider).</li>
            <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Products are typically delivered in universal formats (e.g., PDF). It is
                your responsibility to ensure you have the necessary software and devices to open and read these files.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Ownership and Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>License:</strong> Your purchase grants you a single, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
                use the Product for your personal or internal business use only.</li>
            <li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> You may not share, sell, reproduce, redistribute, republish, or
                sublicense the Product, in whole or in part, to any third party.</li>

        <h3>4. Pricing and Currency</h3>
        <p>All prices are listed in Kenyan Shillings (KES) unless otherwise specified. While we may display equivalent
            prices in other currencies (e.g., USD, GHC, NGN), the final transaction is processed based on the KES price
            and is subject to the exchange rates and fees of your payment provider.</p>

        <h3>5. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Given the digital nature of our ebook packages, which are instantly downloadable and non-returnable, **all
            sales are final and non-refundable.** We encourage customers to carefully read the product descriptions
            before purchase. Refunds will only be considered in the rare event of a duplicate charge or a demonstrated,
            verifiable technical failure on our part that prevents access to the Product.</p>

        <h3>6. Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>The information provided in our ebooks is for educational and informational purposes only. NIKIBA COMPANY
            LIMITED makes no guarantee that following the advice in our Products will result in specific outcomes,
